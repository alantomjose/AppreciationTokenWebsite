The 3 facets to Appreciation

		Current holders and amounts
		Diamond Hands (people who buy and have never sold)
	}
}

2. Asset Creation()
{
	Creating the perfect asset requires experience and technique, chose the best option from our in-house expertise in GLB files, 3-D printing, or something simple that we co-create such as colouring books and posters. 
	Don't forget to chose your perfect custom beat from our library of composed music to add more value to your NFT
}

3. Distribution()

	Save on gas costs by using our contract to distribute across a large list of wallet addresses, or simply create a claiming portal on our website. Layer 2 solutions are always an exciting option as well.
